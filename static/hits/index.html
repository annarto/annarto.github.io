        <h2>Anna Vasof</h2>

                “Hitting My Head On The World” is a series of experimental
                video and sound project consisting of more episodes. I visit
                several cities and I hit my head to different walls and
                surfaces.  On my head is mounted a microphone,  which records
                the sounds of these head-strokes . Each action is filmed from
                the side with a camera connected to the microphone. In this way
                is visible: the action, the sound recording, the surface that I
                hit my head and the urban ambience of the place. Each city has
                its own episode. Their title consists of the names of the
                cities and the word "Hit", for example "Vienna Hit", "Berlin
                Hit" etc. For each episode a music piece is composed from the
                head beats. The music is also used to structure the video
                editing. Each episode is around 2 minutes long.  Hitting the
                head on a wall is a worldwide known gesture. Desperate people
                who do not know what to do next, they hit their heads against
                the wall. But if we observe this action from the perspective of
                the wall, then the wall is injured by a human head and suddenly
                a hopeless action begins to develop humor. In precisely those
                absurd moments in which our morals are paralyzed, we can
                observe and interpret the world from a different perspective.
                In the videos, my head is interpreted as a musical instrument,
                which is played in multiple locations around the world and
                creates an audiovisual "landscape" of the world.
