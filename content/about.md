## General

Anna Vasof is an architect and media artist. Born in 1985, she studied architecture at the University of Thessaly (2010) in Greece and Transmedia Art (2014) at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna. Since 2004 her videos and short movies have been presented in several festivals, some of them winning distinctions. She’s currently writing a Ph.D. thesis about an animation technique that she develops and at the same time working on designing and building innovative mechanisms for producing critical and narrative videos, actions and installations.


## Artist Statement

My work is accessible in a universal way via its wit and mischief. It is grounded in genuine experimentation of the core mechanisms of motion and time based art. I go to the heart of every question and start from zero, reinventing core premises with my own perspective. My Non-Stop Stop-Motion works reinvent  a contemporary expanded cinema and deal with the poetic mechanics of persistence of vision. My works with everyday objects (shoes, brooms, pots etc.) deal with social paradoxes and let us see a familiar world from a different perspective.
